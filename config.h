 * Split a command based on what's between brackets, strings not in brackets are ignored

                   The command will be split to all fields between '[]'. If you want a '[' or ']' in your command, precede it by a '\'
                   If you want a '\', precede it by another '\': '\\' => '\'

 * \param result: if this value is not NULL, this array will be filled with pointers to the different parts.

 *                Make sure it's big enough
 * \param logContext: if not NULL this will be used to log syntax errors.
 * \return: negative if there is a syntax error, otherwise the number of parts
 * NOTE: command will be modified if result != NULL, \0 will be inserted and escape chars are removed if followed by [ or ]
 * NOTE: syntax error message can be very cryptic if result != NULL => check with result == NULL for syntax errors first
 * example:
        cmd = "lol [command] ignored [arg1] [arg2]"
        will result in the following result:
